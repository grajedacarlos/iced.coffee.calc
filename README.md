# Iced Coffee Calc



This application calculates the number of tablespoons of instant coffee needed to prepare a specific number of cups.

(I created this specifically for someone who uses intant coffee to prepare a few cups of cofee at a time to have ready to go for the next day or two. They were having trouble remembering or calculating the amount of instant coffee needed as the amounts made was always different and resulted in the taste and coffee strength being inconsistent.)


Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
